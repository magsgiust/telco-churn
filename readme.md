This repo is for Data Mining II Course through WGU. 

**Goal of the Project**

We have noticed a concerning increase in customer attrition in recent years. The goal of this analysis is to understand which customers are leaving, what is potentially driving these customers to churn, and, based on this data, what could be done to mitigate customer attrition. The data acquired (WGU, 2020) includes 7043 customers who have a tenure of 0 to 72 months. Customers are uniquely identified by a customer ID number. There are another 20 variables that are possible features and one variable, churn, that is the target or outcome variable.
